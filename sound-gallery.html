    <!-- Description for Alex Johnson -->
    <p class="description">
      <strong>Name:</strong> Alex Johnson <br>
      <strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 14/05/1993 <br>
      <strong>Short Description:</strong> Alex is a rockstar software developer, always the one to step up when things get tough. He's the person who solves problems in a heartbeat and keeps the team moving forward. <br>
      <strong>Story:</strong> We want the song to be a fun, celebratory tribute to Alex. Focus on how he’s been a true leader this year — always carrying the team, making sure everything runs smoothly, and keeping things on track. Incorporate some lighthearted corporate speak like "leveraging synergies" and "optimizing workflows" to keep it playful. Make sure it feels like a genuine congratulatory moment, but with some good humor about how he's the one who "delivered all the KPIs." It should be energetic and upbeat, reflecting Alex’s personality.

    <!-- Description for Emma Lawson -->
    <p class="description">
      <strong>Name:</strong> Emma Lawson <br>
      <strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 22/02/1992 <br>
      <strong>Short Description:</strong> Emma and I spent a summer together traveling through the mountains and creating unforgettable memories. She’s always been there for me, and we’ve shared so many great moments. <br>
      <strong>Story:</strong> I want the song to reflect one specific memory — the summer we spent hiking in the mountains. It was one of those moments that’s just stuck with me. Maybe something that talks about the quiet moments, the beauty of nature, and the feeling of being so connected to each other. I’m thinking it should have that warm, nostalgic country feel, like a story about an unforgettable summer. It should capture the simplicity and depth of the memory, something you’d listen to when you’re feeling sentimental.

    <!-- Description for Sarah Thompson -->
    <p class="description">
      <strong>Name:</strong> Sarah Thompson <br>
      <strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 22/08/1990 <br>
      <strong>Short Description:</strong> Sarah’s always off somewhere new, hiking, traveling, just living her best life. She’s the kind of person who makes every day feel like an adventure. <br>
      <strong>Story:</strong> I’m not really sure how to describe this, but maybe something about Sarah’s love of adventure? Like, she’s always going places, trying new things, and pushing herself. I’d love for the song to have an upbeat, happy vibe. Think like... a fun anthem for someone who’s always up for something new. Doesn’t need to be too serious, just full of energy and life. Feel free to play with it.

    <!-- Description for Max the Dog -->
    <p class="description">
      <strong>Name:</strong> Max (The Dog) <br>
      <strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 05/01/2023 <br>
      <strong>Short Description:</strong> Max is the newest addition to our family! He’s an adorable rescue pup who’s already stolen everyone’s heart. <br>
      <strong>Story:</strong> The song should be all about Max and how lucky he is to be in a new home. Make it fun, lively, and upbeat — like a playful little anthem for a cute puppy. Talk about how excited his new family is to have him and how he’s already brought so much joy into their lives. Keep it light-hearted, warm, and filled with love, but in a fun, bouncy way.
