  <div class="lyrics">
Six friends on the hallowed track at Silverstone that day,<br>
Crimson Ferraris gleaming under British skies so gray,<br>
V12 engines screaming, carbon fiber cutting through the spray,<br>
The scent of burning rubber as we pushed the cars to play.<br>
Chuck's bachelor party legend, champagne flowing all around,<br>
The sacred British circuit where racing gods were crowned.<br>
Feels like yesterday when Pirelli tires kissed the rain-slicked ground,<br>
Creating bonds and memories that would forever stay profound.<br>

We became legends on that Formula 1 track,<br>
The rush of speed, adrenaline surging through our veins, no turning back,<br>
Six friends, scarlet stallions roaring past Becketts and Stowe,<br>
Hearts racing with the tachometer, faces all aglow.<br>
Chuck, you made history when our brotherhood was sealed in speed,<br>
Happy birthday to the man who planted friendship's strongest seed,<br>
Racing through life with passion, leaving others in your wake,<br>
The memories we forged that day, no time can ever take.<br>
