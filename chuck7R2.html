      <h3>Lyrics</h3>
<p>Six friends on the hallowed track at Silverstone that day,
Crimson Ferraris gleaming under British skies so gray,
V12 engines screaming, carbon fiber cutting through the spray,
The scent of burning rubber as we pushed the cars to play.
Chuck's bachelor party legend, champagne flowing all around,
The sacred British circuit where racing gods were crowned.
Feels like yesterday when Pirelli tires kissed the rain-slicked ground,
Creating bonds and memories that would forever stay profound.<br>

We became legends on that Formula 1 track,
The rush of speed, adrenaline surging through our veins, no turning back,
Six friends, scarlet stallions roaring past Becketts and Stowe,
Hearts racing with the tachometer, faces all aglow.
Chuck, you made history when our brotherhood was sealed in speed,
Happy birthday to the man who planted friendship's strongest seed,
Racing through life with passion, leaving others in your wake,
The memories we forged that day, no time can ever take.`<br>

Happy birthday to the man who planted friendship's strongest seed,
Racing through life with passion, leaving others in your wake,
The memories we forged that day, no time can ever take.ðŸŽ¶<br>
